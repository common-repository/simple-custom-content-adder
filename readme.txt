A simple plugin that enables you to add some custom content to all of your posts and/or pages.

== Description ==

The Simple Custom Content Adder (SCCA) does exactly what it says on the tin – adds some custom content to all of your posts and pages, simply.

Perhaps you have a promotion you want to add above all your posts, or you wish to add a disclaimer to the bottom? SCCA can cater for both (although not at the same time just yet!).

SCCA utilises features that, as a WordPress user, you will be familiar with. A self-explanatory administration screen will have you showing your Custom Content on your posts and pages in no time!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'simple-custom-content-adder' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to the SCCA Admin Panel via ‘Plugins’ -> ‘Custom Content’ to change the settings as desired.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

SCCA has only just been released so I've not had any questions yet! I'll be happy to answer any that come up!
